    RECORD FROM DEVICES WITHOUT LISTEN (devplan Phase 4b; PRD: "the plugin
    opens a UDP listener and shows its port in the editor; the user enters that
    port in the device's own configuration"). The mock in HTTP-only mode is
    told the registry's port, as a user would tell a device, and its values
    arrive exactly as over LISTEN; two such devices on one machine are told
    apart by path, and what both hold goes to both, counted; a device whose
    websocket streams has its UDP copies ignored; the setting moves the port.

    NO ADDRESS IS TYPED: every node is found in the fixture by what it is.
