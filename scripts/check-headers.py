"""GPL headers on every source file of this repository.

Produces: nothing. Exits 0 when every tracked source file carries the SPDX line
         and either this project's copyright line or an `Origin:` line, 1 otherwise.
Usage:   python3 scripts/check-headers.py
Needs:   python3 and git.

The rule (CLAUDE.md, standing rules): GPLv3 headers in go.dot's form reading
"Copyright (C) 2026 Pierre-Olivier Boulant, Julien Bayle". A file copied from
WFS-DIY or go.dot keeps its original header and gains a one-line `Origin:`
note instead. Documents (*.md), fixtures (*.json) and ThirdParty/ are not
source files and are not checked; docs/spec/ is CC BY 4.0 and says so itself.
